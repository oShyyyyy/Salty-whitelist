- three inredible good whitelist with methods never leaked before (close as good as luaguard? i dont know!)
- some RNGs that maybe you've seen or not, with basic detections.
- two antihooks that work for every single function, 5 or more antihooks dedicated to request function, two pcall dedicated antihooks
